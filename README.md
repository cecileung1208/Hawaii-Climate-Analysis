## Background

The objective of this project is to conduct a climate analysis of Hawaii in order to determine when is the best time to visit.  Data explorations can be done by connecting to the SQLite database provided.  Then, Python and SQL Alchemy can be used to perform the the climate analysis.

## Requirements

1) Line Graph - Plot the Precipitation vs Dates for 1 Year
2) Summary Table - Total number of Observations for each Station
3) Histogram - Frequency Hawaii's Temperature Range from the Most Active Station
4) Climate Flask Application -  Create api routes to return JSON data for the following:
    * Precipitation from the previous year
    * Stations from the datasets
    * Temperature of Observations (TOBS) from the previous year
    * Temperature Statistics for Start Date with the minimum temperature, the average temperature, and the max temperature for a given start date of your choice from the               database.
    * Temperature Statistics for Start Date and End Date with the minimum temperature, the average temperature, and the max temperature for a given start date and end date of         your choice from the database.
5) Hypothesis Testing of Climate Analysis
6) Bar Graph showing the average, minimum, and maximum temperature from chosen vacation dates
7) Calculating the total precipitation for all available stations from chosen vacation dates
8) Stacked line graph of the daily normals from chosen vacation dates

## Scripts

## Results

After settling in my career as a Data Analyst, I have decided to treat myself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii! To help with my trip planning, I need to do some climate analysis on the area.

## **1. - Climate Analysis and Exploration**

Python and SQLAlchemy have been used to conduct climate anlysis and data exploration by connecting to the SQLite Database. 

The analysis is completed by using the [Climate Starter Notebook](https://github.com/cecileung1208/SQLAlchemy-Surfs-Up/blob/master/climate_starter.ipynb) and [Hawaii SQLite Database](https://github.com/cecileung1208/SQLAlchemy-Surfs-Up/blob/master/Resources/hawaii.sqlite) to obtain climate results using the SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.


### **Precipitation Analysis**

Before planning any activities, I want to know if the weather is good!  Otherwise, it would be disappointing if I had to cancel any activities because of rain.

A query have been designed to collect the past 12 months of precipitation data to determine which time of the year have the most rain.

### **Station Analysis**

To ensure that my analysis is accurate, weather information have been gathered from various stations.  

A query have been designed to determine the total number of stations and the most active station with the highest number of observations. 

| Station ID    | Station Name | Total Counts |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
|USC00519281 | WAIHEE 837.5, HI US | 2772|
|USC00519397 | WAIKIKI 717.2, HI US | 2724|
|USC00513117 | KANEOHE 838.1, HI US | 2709|
|USC00519523 | WAIMANALO EXPERIMENTAL FARM, HI US | 2669|
|USC00516128 | MANOA LYON ARBO 785.2, HI US | 2612|
|USC00514830 | KUALOA RANCH HEADQUARTERS 886.9, HI US | 2202|
|USC00511918 | HONOLULU OBSERVATORY 702.2, HI US | 1979|
|USC00517948 | PEARL CITY, HI US | 1372|
|USC00518838 | UPPER WAHIAWA 874.3, HI US | 511|


Then, a histogram has been created to show the frequency of the range of temperature in Hawaii form the most active station.

## **2. - Climate App**

Upon the completion of my initial analysis, a [Flask API file](https://github.com/cecileung1208/SQLAlchemy-Surfs-Up/blob/master/app.py) have been designed for the queries I have developed.  The file can be run on Visual Studio Code.

The Flask API have the following routes:


* **Home page (/)**

* **Precipitation (/api/v1.0/precipitation)**<br/> - Return a JSON list of all precipitation information of the past year.
    
* **Stations (/api/v1.0/stations)**<br/> - Return a JSON list of stations from the dataset.
  
* **TOBS (/api/v1.0/tobs)** <br/> - Return a JSON list of temperature observations (TOBS) for the previous year.
  
* **Temperature Statistics for Start Date (/api/v1.0/startdate)**<br/> - Return a JSON list of the minimum temperature, the average temperature, and the max temperature for a given start date of your choice to the last day on the database.
  
* **Temperature Statistics for Start Date and End Date (/api/v1.0/startdate/enddate)**<br/> - Return a JSON list of the minimum temperature, the average temperature, and the max temperature for a given start date and last date of your choice. 
  
  **Note:**  Dates should be entered in the format YYYY-MM-DD.<br/>
         Example 1 (/api/v1.0/2017-05-01)<br/>
         Example 2 (/api/v1.0/2017-05-01/2017-05-08)<br/>
         
  
## **3. - Other Useful Analysis**

I have conducted additonal analysis to make the most out of my trip in the [Climate Starter Notebook](https://github.com/cecileung1208/SQLAlchemy-Surfs-Up/blob/master/climate_starter.ipynb).

### **Temperature Analysis I**

Analysis have been conducted by determining the averages of June an December for all stations across all available years in the dataset. 

A T-Test has been conducted to determine to test the difference of the mean with the following hypothesis.

Null Hypothesis: Mean Difference = 0<br/>
Alternative Hypothesis: Mean Difference > 0<br/>

P-value = 0.00036573

Since the p-value is almost 0.0004 , there is a difference in the mean temperatures in June and December.  Paired t-tests are considered more powerful than unpaired t-tests because using the same samples eliminiate variation between the samples that could be caused by anything other than what’s being tested.

Details of the average figures are in the [Climate Starter Notebook](https://github.com/cecileung1208/SQLAlchemy-Surfs-Up/blob/master/climate_starter.ipynb)

### **Temperature Analysis II**

My manager have approved my vacation days!  I am off to Hawaii from August 2 to August 10 and will be having lots of fun in the sun!!

The calc_temps function have been created to calculate the min, avg, and max temperatures for my trip.  The below graph shows the range of temperature during August 2 to August 10.

### **Daily Rainfall Analysis**

Calculating the the total rainfall per weather station using the previous year's matching dates for my trip.

|USC00516128|	MANOA LYON ARBO 785.2, HI US|	21.33310|	-157.80250|	152.4|	0.92|
|USC00514830|	KUALOA RANCH HEADQUARTERS 886.9, HI US|	21.52130|	-157.83740|	7.0|	0.20|
|USC00519281|	WAIHEE 837.5, HI US|	21.45167|	-157.84889|	32.9|	0.06|

|USC00519523|	WAIMANALO EXPERIMENTAL FARM, HI US|	21.33556|	-157.71139|	19.5|	0.00|

### **Daily Normals**

The daily_normal function was used to calculate the averages for the min, avg, and max temperatures for my trip.  This date string will be in the format %m-%d that will use all historic TOBS that match that date string.
